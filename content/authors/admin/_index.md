Hi! I am a second year student at IIT Roorkee majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I passionately follow innovations in 
the fields of computer science with potential real world impacts, particularly interested in deep learning. 

At IIT Roorkee I am a member of a deep learning centric discussion group named [Vision and Language Group](https://vlgiitr.github.io/) which conducts workshops and holds
weekly discussions on the latest research in deep learning.
